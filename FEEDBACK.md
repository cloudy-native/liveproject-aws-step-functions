Fair warning. Some of the comments are nit-picky.

## 1.1

Typo: ...single points of failure...

Instructions for finding the application `manning-calandra-lp-s1p1` could be more explicit. The application shows up in the Private Applications tab because it creates IAM resources.

I think we should make it clear that `public process(...) { }` is a method of `Order` by showing more of the class.

In the diagram, not `BoohHotel` and `BoohMuseam`.

Not sure what START/End BookHotel specification box means.

```
exports.handler = async (evt) => {
   // hotel's booking process

   return var;
}
```

is not a valid JavaScript function. `var` is a reserved word.

Typo: "that will broke" -> "that will break"

## 2.1

Maybe "without the console" rather than "without these facilities"

Typo: "If a function have to write" -> If a function has to write"

The role is technically a "service role."

Typo: "so functionâ€™s that will assume this role" -> "so functions that will assume this role"

Your explanation of roles and handlers is really good.

I'm not sure how a "sub-method" is not just a method.
